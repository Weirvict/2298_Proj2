# 2298_Proj2

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a large-scale e-commerce dataset using PySpark for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for visualization and reporting. Mock data is generated (10k-15k rows) based on given schema with manufactured data irregularities (<5%).
The goal is to uncover sales trends, product popularity, and customer behavior patterns across time and geography.

### Rouge Records
To simulate real-world data imperfections, each dataset includes <5% rogue records â€” examples may include:
- Missing or malformed values (e.g., negative prices, blank fields)
- Incorrect country or category names
- Duplicated entries
- Outlier order quantities
